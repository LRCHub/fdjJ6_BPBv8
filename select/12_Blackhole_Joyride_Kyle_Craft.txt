Well, I heard they strung you out on a midnight line
I heard about it when you cracked
And I see you found yourself a new set of lies
Where do you go to hear a thing like that?
And you found that farewell note
Your footsteps dancin' toward the door
In the fine print of the words she wrote
You can't find a pattern anymore

And now daylight burns your eyes
And your girl's long gone, forever and ever
You wonder what it's like?
Well it's hell 'round here, but it's my kind of weather
And oh! To be free!
It gets old, like anything, anything
And boy! You don't see
What hurts worse than falling out
Is falling back in when she leaves
Leaves

So jump a black hole
Take a joyride
Scratch the 8-ball
Wet it all night
But don't shut the door before (?)(1:42)

Well, I cut your corner, catchin' you right on time
You know I like to hang around
But the party turns into a firin' line
Every time I show my face in town
Now I can't give it all, you know
Feel free to show me to the door
I offered you my bad advice
I offered, but you wanted more

Now the limelight burns your eyes
And the girl you loved's gone forever and ever
You wonder what it's like?
Well it's hell 'round here, man, it don't get much better
But oh! To be free!
It gets old, like anything, anything
Boy! You don't see
What hurts worse than falling out
Is falling back in when she leaves
Leaves
Leaves

So jump a black hole
Take a joyride
Scratch the 8-ball
Wet it all night
But don't shut the door before (?)(3:24)
